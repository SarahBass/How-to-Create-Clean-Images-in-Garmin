My Process of Creating Clean images in Garmin

Many have asked me how I am able to create such clear and clean watchface images by using a javascript run art program called Vectornator. 
I am able to optomize my bitmaps for Garmin by exporting vector SVG art into sharp looking .png files that use the exact HEX Color codes matching each watch model using AMOLED, 64 Bit Memory, or 16 Bit Memory Screens.

This will help you make a high quality display for multiple resolution sizes and model types. 

I hope that helps!
