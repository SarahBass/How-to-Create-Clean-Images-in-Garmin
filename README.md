My Process of Creating Clean images in Garmin

Please Read my Garmin Post Here om how I am able to create such clear and clean watchface images by using a javascript run art program called Vectornator to export vector SVG art into sharp looking .png files that use HEX Color codes exactly matching the watch model AMOLED, 64 Bit Memory, or 16 Bit Memory Screen.
